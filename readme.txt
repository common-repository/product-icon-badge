This plugin allows you to create custom badges for your products.

== Description ==

**COMPATIBLE WITH WORDPRESS 5.1.* AND WOOCOMMERCE 3.5.* **

This plugin allows you to add standard badges or your images on shop and single product pages.
In the WordPress Back-end you’ll see a new option page “Badge Options” and, when you are editing a single product, a new woocommerce option tab “Badge”.
You can upload different image type: JPG, PNG and GIF.

Badge: 
If you set this last field “badge” on yes you can choose a standard badge or upload/select an image.
If you want have a general badge for this and other products you must set "badge" field to “yes” and click on Save changes without further intervention.

Badge Options:
In the options page “Badge Options” you can select/upload images and this becomes a general badge. You can display it where the field “badge: yes or no” is set to “yes” on woocommerce tab “badge”

If you set both:
-if you set general image and single product image you see the last one;
-if you set general image and single product standard badge you see general image;
-if you set single product image and standard badges you see the image;
images come first in each case.
